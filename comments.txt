ng-app
  a directive, a concept
  - does the Bootstrapping of the AngularJS.
  - allows you to annotate 
  any existing HTML element with the tag
  AngularJS, you can only 
  work on, control, and modify 
  that particular section of the HTML,
  don't process anything outside.
  AngularJS, handle any element 
  that is a child of that,
  and you can annotate them
  with directives.
  Order:
  1) DOM ready event 
    (after the entire document has been loaded))
  2) AngularJS finds this directive 
  3) When it finds it
  4) Find and load the specified module
    and attaches it to the DOM element
  5) Look at the children elements
    find all the directives and bind statements
  6) each time AngularJS hits 
    ng-controller or 
    ng-repeat
    create a scope in AngularJS
  7) add watchers and listeneres
    on the vars that the HTML accesses
    and keeps track of the current value
    for each of them in order to update the value
    each time it changes
